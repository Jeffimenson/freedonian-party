            <button id="join">Join our ranks today</button>
            <p>We're not here for the money, nor the glory, nor the fame - just the American people, because that's what's politics is really about.</p>
            <p>The nation needs leadership that won't bring America right or left, but backwards - back to the roots of our American ideals. </p>
            <p>Drawing from the virtues of our founding fathers, the ancient stoics, and the pythagorean thinkers, we will lead this country to its former glory.</p>
            <p>We're not here to fight for the favor of corporations. We're going to do what's right, until there's nothing left. </p>
            <p>We know what's right for this country. Do you?</p>

                        <h3>Immigration</h3>
                        <p>
                            We envision immigration policy balancing compassion with national interests. An efficient system for legal immigration should be rooted 
                            in our government, and it shall prioritize fair pathways to legal status so we may make way for valuable, future contributors to our 
                            society. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Economy</h3>
                        <p>
                            We propose a flat-tax system, asserting that a simplified, uniform tax structure that does not discriminate based on income will stimulate entrepreneurship and economic 
                            growth. By this, we may ensure the US remains a top economic power in the world for many decades to come. 
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Gun control</h3>
                        <p>We uphold the second amendment as a foundational right for our citizens, fighting endlessly to protect it by opposing state laws unfairly restricting responsible 
                            citizens from obtaining the means for self-defense. The Freedonian Party hopes that addressing mental health issues rampant in society will mitigate the public 
                            safety concerns that are so often scapegoated onto firearms. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Conflict in Ukraine</h3>
                        <p>Learning from the lessons brought from the destruction of the past world wars, the Freedonian party aims to make moves to deter aggression from Russia by taking 
                            an active approach in aiding Ukraine's war efforts. We will firmly solidify the US' position as a peacemaker of the world, and shall make sure Ukraine obtains the 
                            resources they need for their battles.

                        <h3>Peace in middle east</h3>
                        <p>The Freedonian Party wishes to spread the peace and freedom of our nations across our borders to struggling nations. To handle conflicts in the middle east, 
                            we propose the US to push itself and its UN allies to occupy unstable sections of the region to ensure communities are allotted opportunities for infrastructure 
                            and societal development without the threat of constant violence.

                        </div>
                        <h3>National security</h3>
                        <p>The party advocates for the US to take an active role in global affairs, as it has traditionally done so in the past. Increased military spending will increase 
                            our nations strength and deter foreign aggression, and ensure the protection of democracy and American ideals. </p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Environment</h3>
                        <p>Our environmental stance is committed towards responsible, and realistic stewardship of our planet. We advocate for responsible use of resources, and a steady 
                            transition of our industries towards reliance on nuclear energy to combat our nations unhealthy reliance on fossil fuels.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
                        <p>Health is a personal journey, and the Freedonian Party wholeheartedly respects this by creating policies that empower individuals to make their own decisions, 
                            while also ensuring citizens can practically access healthcare when they are in need of it. 
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Social welfare</h3>
                        <p>Our party's thinkers champion a community-focused approach to social welfare, emphasizing strength in local networks. Through decentralized, responsive social 
                            programs that collaborate thoroughly with local communities, we can foster self-sufficiency and greater community bonding among the people, and ensure our 
                            Americans can persevere through the unique challenges of every American people group.

            <h3>Taking American Education by Storm</h3>
            <p>
                Improving our education system is our most important goal, as the strength of our future generations is what the strength of our nation is founded on. The Freedonian Party firmly advocates for fostering a dynamic education system suited towards preparing the newer generations for the unpredictable
                hardships of the modern world. We aim to push for greater investment in IDEA (Innovation and Design Thinking, Entrepreneurship, Arts) curriculum
                across the nation in order to ensure we cultivate the bright minds of America's youth to embrace their talents, ambition, and ingenuity.
